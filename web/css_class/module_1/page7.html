    <p class="common-text">Under the water, everything else disappeared. Up above were all his
    problems, the heavy, dry world that dragged him down. The water was his
    element. He wished he could go to school in the water; in the northwest,
    he'd heard, there were aquatic schools for otters, beavers, marmots, and
    water rats. But he didn't live in the northwest, and there were no aquatic
    schools in Hilltown.</p>

  <p class="common-text">Only two public pools, even, and they were always crowded with non-aquatics, usually kids, splashing around and screaming. But under the water, in the deep end, he couldn't hear them or see them. He cut from one side of the pool to the other, holding his breath as long as he could so that he could knife through the water, eyes open but unfocused, just reveling in its rush through his fur, the low rumble that was all the outside world filtered through its insulating layers. In the water, he could go anywhere, do anything.</p>
  
  <p class="common-text">He angled to the surface for a breath, and just that quickly was back under the water again. There were a couple other swimmers in the deep end, laboring near the surface to the end of the pool, doubling over and kicking off to struggle back to the other end. He slid under them with ease, swimming in circles, touching one wall after another.</p>
  
  <p class="common-text">A shadow lurched towards him. He changed direction fast, to avoid the shape, and stars exploded around his head as he hit something much harder than water. Air bubbled out of him as he pressed both his webbed paws to his head, bobbing to the surface. Kicking to keep himself afloat, he leaned against the edge of the pool as the shock wore off and the pain started to set in. "Ow. Ow ow ow."</p>
  
  <p class="common-text">"Man, I'm really sorry," said a low tenor voice behind him. He smelled wet fur and musk. "You okay?"</p>
  
  <p class="common-text">"Yeah." He found the spot on his head that had hit the wall, probed with
  his fingers, and winced. It wasn't swelling up yet, but he had a feeling it
  would. Experimentally, he ducked under the water, but the cool water only
  soothed him a little, and his head started to throb. Time to get out,
  definitely.</p>
  
  <p class="common-text">He broke the surface again, hung there, and sighed. To his surprise, the same tenor said, "It doesn't look too bad."</p>
  
  <p class="common-text">Kory turned, surprised. He'd figured the guy would've taken off once he said he was okay.</p>
  
  <p class="common-text">Crouched on the side of the pool, a young fox about his age smiled back at him. His fur was the color of night, glossy with water, except just under his throat, where a shock of white dripped. His long tail lay curled behind him, plastered to the tile, and his long legs were tucked under him. "I mean, there's no blood in the water," he went on. He had dark eyes that Kory thought were black at first, and his smile was warm and genuine.</p>
