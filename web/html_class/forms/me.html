    <h2>My name is Hiram.</h2>

    <p>Hi! I've been studying computer science at USP since 2019. Through the years, I've learned many different areas which day after day make me feel happy for choosing computer science as a career.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm working in many projects including the <a href="https://ganesh.icmc.usp.br">Ganesh study group</a>, a Research Lab, and freelance projects. That is always making me think about how to organize my time to maximize the number of things that I want to do. Also, I like to talk to people, play with my friends (that's all i can do rn) and be with my family.</p>
